      You may know me from my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8yeTczadqdARzQUp29PJw) or
      from one of my courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/william-fiset). Creating eductional computer
      science videos content is my main side hustle. I teach educational content on YouTube and Udemy because there 
      exists a need to create high quality content about complex topics in computer science. 
      The areas I tend to focus on are data structures and algorithms, because together I believe that they are the most important topics to master on the road to becoming an exemplary software engineer.
